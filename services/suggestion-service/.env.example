# No specific environment variables are strictly needed for this basic version.
# However, if you were to integrate with an external AI service (e.g., OpenAI),
# you would add API keys here.

# Example for OpenAI:
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# Example for a hypothetical internal recommendation engine URL:
# RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_URL="http://internal-recommender:9000/api/recommend"
